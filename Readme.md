# This repo contains problems from different Google coding competitions.

I used them to practice coding and algotrithm design skills. And to prepare for competition, too. 

I have participated in some competitions with modest success. 
Google's coding problems are usually formulated as a long story with many details and even hints. 

There are usually two tests to pass: one is a small test, which can be passed with a brute-force solution,
another one is a large test which requires a smarter algorithm.

It's good to know that a "smart" algorithm can be written in 20-30 lines of code, so don't over think it.
